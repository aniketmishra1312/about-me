    <h2>
     1.  "Discrete Mathematics"
    </h2>
        <b>Faculty: </b>  Prof. Manoj Jha and Dr. Madhvi Shakya
       <p>Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. 
           In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", 
           the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and
            statements in logic[1] – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.
            [2][3] Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, 
            discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets[4] (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers).
             However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete Mathematics" 
             <br> <b> Expectations :</b> To Have no doubts in this subject. <br>
             <b>  My Experience :</b> Teaching Method of sir / mam is very good. </p>
           <br><br>

               2.  "Data Structure"
               
           </h2>
           <b>Faculty: </b> Prof. Amit Bhagat
<p> Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising 
    data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc.
     Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence,
      Graphics and many more. 
    <br> <b> Expectations :</b> Sir have very vast knowledge In programming and i want to explore my knowledge in coding. <br>
    <b> My Experience : </b>Teaching Method of sir is Outstanding and I have not any confusion in any time.

        3. "Operating System"
    </h2>
    <b>Faculty: </b> Prof. Vishnu Priya
    <p>An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware.
         An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management,
          memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices 
          such as disk drives and printers. 
        <br> <b>Expectations : </b> Understanding OS in such a way so that I remember for a long time. <br>
        <b>   My Experience : </b>The Real time examples of mam give us clear meaning of topics.

       <h2>
           4. "Computer Architecture and Organization"
       </h2>
       <b>Faculty: </b> Prof. Anoop Tiwari
       <p> In general terms, the architecture of a computer system can be considered as a catalogue of tools or attributes
            that are visible to the user such as instruction sets, number of bits used for data, addressing techniques, etc.
          Whereas, Organization of a computer system defines the way system is structured so that all those catalogued tools can be used. 
          The significant components of Computer organization are ALU, CPU, memory and memory organization.
        <br> <b> Expectations : </b>Learning architecture and organisation in such way so that i understand each topics. <br>
        <b> My Experience :</b> Since I came to Manit I learn a lot in architectute.
        </p> <br> <br>
        <h2>
            5. "C programming"
        </h2>
        <b>Faculty: </b> Prof. Anirban Choudhary
        <p>C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories 
            to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly
             interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.
             C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language. <br>
            <b> Expectations :</b> Learning C Programming with no doubts. <br>
           <b>  My Experience :</b> Sir is going with my expectations and also going with each and every concept in depth.
             </p> <br><br>

                 6. "Business communication"
             </h2>
             <b>Faculty:</b> Prof. Anjuli Jain
             <p>Business communication encompasses topics such as marketing, brand management, customer relations, consumer behavior,
                  advertising, public relations, corporate communication, community engagement, reputation management, interpersonal
                   communication, employee engagement, and event management. It is closely related to the fields of professional communication 
                   and technical communication. 
                <br> <b> Expectations :</b> I want to enhance my communication skills so that I give my best in Any interview. <br>
                <b> My Experience : </b> The Knowledge and guidance the mam is giving to us with live examples so that we can learn more about personality and Group Discussions.

                    7. "Web Devlopment"
                </h2>
                <b>Faculty:</b> Prof. Anirban Choudhary
                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or
                     an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single 
                     static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses,
                      and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers,
                       may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, 
                       Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
                 <br> <b>Expectations :</b>   I want to great web developer . <br>
                 <b> My Experience :</b>   Sir is going with my expectations and also going with each and every concept in depth.
